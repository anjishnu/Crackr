(This is a one-off job, however, if you quickly and accurately dispatch this task set, you may be considered for potential ongoing VA work.) IMPORTANT: I am inviting many ""watch list"" people to apply for this VA POSITION. Some of you were listed under ""Writing & Translation;"" however, a few of you may be motivated and competent to work as general VA's, so I have invited you, too. For this initial stage of my project(s) I require assistance for a quick 24 to 72 hour turnaround on specific task sets, helping me and my web designer locate, organize and possibly arrange/set up needed material. This will likely include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following objectives: -- Data gathering & preparation for pages listing local nature & science centers; -- Research, locate low cost/no cost sound track(s) for site (e.g., Mozart concertos) -- Research and recommend easiest/best password management software -- Research/recommend phone/messaging system to forward after-hours calls (to be dealt with during daytime hours) -- Locate, recommend (and possibly arrange for) free or low cost, copyright-safe content: Subject: HENRY DAVID THOREAU, WALDEN POND, THE TRANSCENDENTALISTS; -- Locate, recommend (and possibly arrange for) free or low cost, copyright-safe content: Subjects: Organisms (and related activities): WILD BIRDS, BIRD WATCHING; PLANTS (wildflowers, trees & shrubs); WILDLIFE/ANIMALS (reptiles & amphibians; mammals; insects; etc.--all creatures should be indigenous to the northeastern U. S. and Canada). To be considered for this job, and to indicate that you are actually reading these job details, in your proposal/reply please be sure to tell me your favorite kind of bird, plant, or animal, or another aspect of the natural environment that you find interesting or otherwise compelling. IDEAL (LONGER TERM) VA CANDIDATE MUST BE: well spoken and exceptionally facile with the English language, with a nearly flawless grasp of English spelling, punctuation, syntax, grammar, etc.. Must also be capable of competent, highly detail-oriented proofreading, editing and (possibly) actual content creation/writing for my niche website. Proofing/editing of print-on-paper books and e-books is also a possibility for the ideal candidate, or at least lending help with this. (I work with a gifted book designer and website developer; the successful longer-term VA candidate will be asked to work cooperatively with her, in support of her superb work. Based in Oregon, she works with me through the Basecamp project software). That said, the ideal VA for my nascent publishing company will bring to bear a variety of other competencies, including the basic organizational expertise desired by most small business VA clients. (My initially required tasks, however, will mainly include researching/mining/scraping the internet with a discerning eye for niche-pertinent website and blog content. The first set of tasks will also likely include helping with social media setup, with the possibility of s-media management down the line.) MORE INFO: My Book & E-book Audience: the general reader and enthusiasts (or future enthusiasts!) of the nineteenth-century American naturalist-philosopher Henry David Thoreau. My Website/Blog Audience: science, nature, wildlife and wild bird enthusiasts; also educators and students of natural history, biology and/or the life sciences in general (this is a website linked to an associated blog); and H. D. Thoreau enthusiasts. Regions Covered: The web site and blog will initially be focused on the nature, wildlife and wild birds of Connecticut, Southern New England, New England and the northeastern U. S. (Pretty much in that order.) If this sounds like it is up your alley please don't delay--I look forward to hearing from you very soon!

The attached is just a short selection, as an example. The red writing shows what I want you to find. For each company, I need someone to find out and record in the spreadsheet: 1.the website address (Example: ) Suggestions: Use Google! 2. try to find the name of 2 employees or more in the H.R. (Human Resources) Dept. (first choice!) or if that cannot be found, then any member of the management team (second choice). Note: If you find a listing somewhere of many employees' names at that company, that's even better. Please copy them all together in bulk and paste them all into the spreadsheet for me. Suggestions: - check the company's own website under pages such as 'Careers' or 'Job Openings' or 'About us' or 'Management Team'. - check Linked In or Google or Twitter. - do some detective work! Get creative! For example, in the Excel spreadsheet attached, you can see I found the name and email of some people called Steve and Vicente and Bob. These names weren't easy to find on the company website, so I had to go onto Linked In and search for the company name, '2020exhibits'. The search result showed me there was someone named ""Steve B."" currently employed there. So I searched on Google for: Steve @2020exhibits.com ...and the email address came up. Unfortunately, this employee does not work in the Houston branch. But it's OK, because at least now we know the email pattern that company uses. So again, looking in LinkedIn, I saw someone with the job of ""I/D Supervisor at 2020exhibits"" and this person DOES work in Houston. So on Google, I search for: I/D Supervisor 2020exhibits Houston ...and the name Vicente Ramirez appears! Great! Now we have a Houston employee's name and his email address will probably be the same pattern as Steve Gorham. And still on the same page in Google, somewhere below I can see that it lists Bob Babine is the President of the 2020exhibits company! Fantastic! So now we can assume we have his email address must be (or since Bob is short for Robert, it might be so let's save both of them, just in case!) 3. the email addresses of one or more of those employees. If you were able to give me lots of employee names from that one company, then if you just give me the email 'pattern' (example: or ) that the company uses, it's OK too. I can use the same pattern for each employee's name. Suggestions: - check the company's own website. - use Google to search for @anycompany.com and ""@anycompany.com"" and Peter Smith @anycompany.com Note: If no specific employee name and email can be found from their website, please try to get an overall generic email (example: ), but this is not really what I want. It should only be the last resort. Desired Skills: Admin Assistant Data Entry Research>"

(This is a one-off job, however, if you quickly and accurately dispatch this task set, you may be considered for potential ongoing VA work.) IMPORTANT: I am inviting many ""watch list"" people to apply for this VA POSITION. Some of you were listed under ""Writing & Translation;"" however, a few of you may be motivated and competent to work as general VA's, so I have invited you, too. For this initial stage of my project(s) I require assistance for a quick 24 to 72 hour turnaround on specific task sets, helping me and my web designer locate, organize and possibly arrange/set up needed material. This will likely include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following objectives: -- Data gathering & preparation for pages listing local nature & science centers; -- Research, locate low cost/no cost sound track(s) for site (e.g., Mozart concertos) -- Research and recommend easiest/best password management software -- Research/recommend phone/messaging system to forward after-hours calls (to be dealt with during daytime hours) -- Locate, recommend (and possibly arrange for) free or low cost, copyright-safe content: Subject: HENRY DAVID THOREAU, WALDEN POND, THE TRANSCENDENTALISTS; -- Locate, recommend (and possibly arrange for) free or low cost, copyright-safe content: Subjects: Organisms (and related activities): WILD BIRDS, BIRD WATCHING; PLANTS (wildflowers, trees & shrubs); WILDLIFE/ANIMALS (reptiles & amphibians; mammals; insects; etc.--all creatures should be indigenous to the northeastern U. S. and Canada). To be considered for this job, and to indicate that you are actually reading these job details, in your proposal/reply please be sure to tell me your favorite kind of bird, plant, or animal, or another aspect of the natural environment that you find interesting or otherwise compelling. IDEAL (LONGER TERM) VA CANDIDATE MUST BE: well spoken and exceptionally facile with the English language, with a nearly flawless grasp of English spelling, punctuation, syntax, grammar, etc.. Must also be capable of competent, highly detail-oriented proofreading, editing and (possibly) actual content creation/writing for my niche website. Proofing/editing of print-on-paper books and e-books is also a possibility for the ideal candidate, or at least lending help with this. (I work with a gifted book designer and website developer; the successful longer-term VA candidate will be asked to work cooperatively with her, in support of her superb work. Based in Oregon, she works with me through the Basecamp project software). That said, the ideal VA for my nascent publishing company will bring to bear a variety of other competencies, including the basic organizational expertise desired by most small business VA clients. (My initially required tasks, however, will mainly include researching/mining/scraping the internet with a discerning eye for niche-pertinent website and blog content. The first set of tasks will also likely include helping with social media setup, with the possibility of s-media management down the line.) MORE INFO: My Book & E-book Audience: the general reader and enthusiasts (or future enthusiasts!) of the nineteenth-century American naturalist-philosopher Henry David Thoreau. My Website/Blog Audience: science, nature, wildlife and wild bird enthusiasts; also educators and students of natural history, biology and/or the life sciences in general (this is a website linked to an associated blog); and H. D. Thoreau enthusiasts. Regions Covered: The web site and blog will initially be focused on the nature, wildlife and wild birds of Connecticut, Southern New England, New England and the northeastern U. S.
